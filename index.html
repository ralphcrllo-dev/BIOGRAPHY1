            <h2>Childhood Story</h2>
            <p>
                As a child, I really loved being outdoors with my friends.<sup>1</sup>
                We would gather almost every afternoon to play the popular games of the 90s.<sup>2</sup>
                I remember playing langit-lupa, where we had to jump on higher ground to avoid getting tagged.<sup>3</sup>
                We also played tumbang-preso, hitting the can with our slippers and running around excitedly.<sup>4</sup>
                Another favorite was patintero, where we blocked each other's ways with fast movements.<sup>5</sup>
                Tagu-taguan, or a game of hide-and-seek, was always exciting because we had to find the best hiding spots.<sup>6</sup>
                There was also the game of piko, which involved hopping with balance and laughter on drawn squares.<sup>7</sup>
                These games were more than fun; they taught us teamwork and creativity.<sup>8</sup>
                Joy, energy, and endless afternoons were the contents of my childhood.<sup>9</sup>
                The streets were our playground, and every day felt like an adventure.<sup>10</sup>
                Again, through these games, I learned how to interact with people of different personalities.<sup>11</sup>
                Second, I learned patience when it was not my turn yet.<sup>12</sup>
                And third, determination was vital in insisting that one wins.<sup>13</sup>
                Simple activities shaped my character in ways I did not realize then.<sup>14</sup>
                They gave me enough self-confidence to face any challenge.<sup>15</sup>
                It also instilled in me my love for physical activities.<sup>16</sup>
                Eventually, these games later transformed into real sports.<sup>17</sup>
                I started to play basketball with passion, then I got interested in volleyball.<sup>18</sup>
                These sports built up my foundation for discipline and teamwork.<sup>19</sup>
                Now, looking back, I see how these childhood memories have built me up to who I am today.<sup>20</sup>

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                I have spent my teenage years in Quezon City, studying in private schools.<sup>1</sup>
                I was not alone in school because my cousins and brothers were with me, which made it all the more meaningful.<sup>2</sup>
                That school became special to me because it was where I met all my friends who completed my teenage years.<sup>3</sup>
                I still remember how much we loved to play basketball before the pandemic.<sup>4</sup>
                We traveled to places just to play basketball.<sup>5</sup>
                Sometimes, these games caused fights with other groups we encountered.<sup>6</sup>
                And though there were fights, those moments became special memories.<sup>7</sup>
                They bonded us all together as friends, and their bond remains up to this time.<sup>8</sup>
                Once we get together now, they still talk about those experiences with glee.<sup>9</sup>
                There was even an instance when our group had an outing.<sup>10</sup>
                In that outing, some of my friends argued because of teasing.<sup>11</sup>
                The argument blew into a physical fight.<sup>12</sup>
                We were mad at each other, but we all went home together.<sup>13</sup>
                Although misunderstandings occurred, they reconciled before going to our respective houses.<sup>14</sup>
                That taught us how to forgive.<sup>15</sup>
                It also showed us that real friendship can withstand problems.<sup>16</sup>
                My teenage years were full of laughter, sporty times, and lessons about loyalty.<sup>17</sup>
                Basketball was not just basketball; it was a way of bonding.<sup>18</sup>
                Those friendships I built during those years remain valuable to me.<sup>19</sup>
                My teenage years molded my social life and taught me resilience.<sup>20</sup>

            <h2>College Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My college experience has been surreal because I meet different kinds of people every day.<sup>1</sup>
                I have classmates who come from various backgrounds, and each one has a unique story.<sup>2</sup>
                Despite the diversity, I have found a group of friends I bond with regularly.<sup>3</sup>
                These are the people I treasure and hope to keep in my life.<sup>4</sup>
                I know that in college, nothing is permanent.<sup>5</sup>
                Even the friends you see every day may eventually leave.<sup>6</sup>
                Some may become irregular students, while others may fail and stop studying.<sup>7</sup>
                That reality makes me value my current friendships even more.<sup>8</sup>
                At the same time, I feel lost in my chosen course.<sup>9</sup>
                This is not my dream course, and I cannot yet see myself as an IT professional.<sup>10</sup>
                I sometimes question whether I am on the right path.<sup>11</sup>
                However, I do not allow these doubts to stop me.<sup>12</sup>
                I remind myself that my loved ones are supporting my education.<sup>13</sup>
                Because of their sacrifices, I continue to study with determination.<sup>14</sup>
                I grab every opportunity to learn new skills related to my course.<sup>15</sup>
                I practice coding and attend lectures even when it feels difficult.<sup>16</sup>
                I try to absorb as much knowledge as I can in every class.<sup>17</sup>
                I also join group activities to improve my teamwork.<sup>18</sup>
                My college life is a journey of self-discovery and a test of patience and responsibility.<sup>19</sup>
                I may not be where I dreamed to be, but I am learning to embrace the path I am on.<sup>20</sup>
