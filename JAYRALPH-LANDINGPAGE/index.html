          <h3><span class="icon">👶</span> Childhood</h3>
          <p>As a child, I really loved being outdoors with my friends.<sup>1</sup>
                We would gather almost every afternoon to play the popular games of the 90s.<sup>2</sup>
                I remember playing langit-lupa, where we had to jump on higher ground to avoid getting tagged.<sup>3</sup>
                We also played tumbang-preso, hitting the can with our slippers and running around excitedly.<sup>4</sup>
                Another favorite was patintero, where we blocked each other's ways with fast movements.<sup>5</sup>
                Tagu-taguan, or a game of hide-and-seek, was always exciting because we had to find the best hiding spots.<sup>6</sup>
                There was also the game of piko, which involved hopping with balance and laughter on drawn squares.<sup>7</sup>
                These games were more than fun; they taught us teamwork and creativity.<sup>8</sup>
                Joy, energy, and endless afternoons were the contents of my childhood.<sup>9</sup>
                The streets were our playground, and every day felt like an adventure.<sup>10</sup>
                Again, through these games, I learned how to interact with people of different personalities.<sup>11</sup>
                Second, I learned patience when it was not my turn yet.<sup>12</sup>
                And third, determination was vital in insisting that one wins.<sup>13</sup>
                Simple activities shaped my character in ways I did not realize then.<sup>14</sup>
                They gave me enough self-confidence to face any challenge.<sup>15</sup>
                It also instilled in me my love for physical activities.<sup>16</sup>
                Eventually, these games later transformed into real sports.<sup>17</sup>
                I started to play basketball with passion, then I got interested in volleyball.<sup>18</sup>
                These sports built up my foundation for discipline and teamwork.<sup>19</sup>
                Now, looking back, I see how these childhood memories have built me up to who I am today.<sup>20</sup></p>

          <h3><span class="icon">🎓</span> Teenage Years</h3>
          <p>I have spent my teenage years in Quezon City, studying in private schools.<sup>1</sup>
                I was not alone in school because my cousins and brothers were with me, which made it all the more meaningful.<sup>2</sup>
                That school became special to me because it was where I met all my friends who completed my teenage years.<sup>3</sup>
                I still remember how much we loved to play basketball before the pandemic.<sup>4</sup>
                We traveled to places just to play basketball.<sup>5</sup>
                Sometimes, these games caused fights with other groups we encountered.<sup>6</sup>
                And though there were fights, those moments became special memories.<sup>7</sup>
                They bonded us all together as friends, and their bond remains up to this time.<sup>8</sup>
                Once we get together now, they still talk about those experiences with glee.<sup>9</sup>
                There was even an instance when our group had an outing.<sup>10</sup>
                In that outing, some of my friends argued because of teasing.<sup>11</sup>
                The argument blew into a physical fight.<sup>12</sup>
                We were mad at each other, but we all went home together.<sup>13</sup>
                Although misunderstandings occurred, they reconciled before going to our respective houses.<sup>14</sup>
                That taught us how to forgive.<sup>15</sup>
                It also showed us that real friendship can withstand problems.<sup>16</sup>
                My teenage years were full of laughter, sporty times, and lessons about loyalty.<sup>17</sup>
                Basketball was not just basketball; it was a way of bonding.<sup>18</sup>
                Those friendships I built during those years remain valuable to me.<sup>19</sup>
                My teenage years molded my social life and taught me resilience.<sup>20</sup></p>

          <h3><span class="icon">🎯</span> College Experience</h3>
          <p>My college experience has been surreal because I meet different kinds of people every day.<sup>1</sup>
                I have classmates who come from various backgrounds, and each one has a unique story.<sup>2</sup>
                Despite the diversity, I have found a group of friends I bond with regularly.<sup>3</sup>
                These are the people I treasure and hope to keep in my life.<sup>4</sup>
                I know that in college, nothing is permanent.<sup>5</sup>
                Even the friends you see every day may eventually leave.<sup>6</sup>
                Some may become irregular students, while others may fail and stop studying.<sup>7</sup>
                That reality makes me value my current friendships even more.<sup>8</sup>
                At the same time, I feel lost in my chosen course.<sup>9</sup>
                This is not my dream course, and I cannot yet see myself as an IT professional.<sup>10</sup>
                I sometimes question whether I am on the right path.<sup>11</sup>
                However, I do not allow these doubts to stop me.<sup>12</sup>
                I remind myself that my loved ones are supporting my education.<sup>13</sup>
                Because of their sacrifices, I continue to study with determination.<sup>14</sup>
                I grab every opportunity to learn new skills related to my course.<sup>15</sup>
                I practice coding and attend lectures even when it feels difficult.<sup>16</sup>
                I try to absorb as much knowledge as I can in every class.<sup>17</sup>
                I also join group activities to improve my teamwork.<sup>18</sup>
                My college life is a journey of self-discovery and a test of patience and responsibility.<sup>19</sup>
                I may not be where I dreamed to be, but I am learning to embrace the path I am on.<sup>20</sup></p>

          <h3>Marathon</h3>
          <p>Everyday feels like a marathon in IT, and honestly, I wouldn't survive without my go-to tools. Canva saves me when I need quick visuals, Google Workspace keeps my team connected, and virtual machines let me experiment without fear. But beyond tools, I've been reflecting on how AI is reshaping our work and how programming challenges push me to grow.</p>
          
          <h3>Exploration</h3>
          <p>I can't imagine working without Canva, it's my shortcut to design without being a designer. Google Workspace is my lifeline for collaboration; I've lost count of how many projects were saved by Docs and Sheets. And virtual machines? They're my safe playground for testing code without breaking my actual system. Right now, AI feels like both a blessing and a challenge. It speeds up tasks like debugging and documentation, but it also forces me to rethink how I approach problems. Sometimes I wonder: am I learning less because AI helps too much, or am I learning more because it pushes me to think differently?
The Programming Language That Challenges Me Most, For me, it's Java and C#. The syntax, the memory management, the endless debugging, it's like climbing a mountain with no clear peak. But every time I conquer a bug, I feel a rush of accomplishment that no easy language could give me. People think programming is about typing fast, but it's not. It's about thinking, planning, and solving problems. I've spent hours staring at the screen without typing a single line, just figuring out logic. That's the real work — typing is just the final step.</p>
          
          <h3>Realization</h3>
          <p>Looking back, I realize tools make me efficient, but challenges make me resilient. AI is here to stay, and instead of fearing it, I want to adapt and grow with it. My takeaway? IT isn't about speed or shortcuts — it's about mindset. And my plan is simple: keep learning, keep experimenting, and never stop questioning.</p>

          <h3>The Struggle</h3>
          <p>I remember the moment I tried and failed at my first dunk attempt. Everything seemed wrong, my vertical jump was nowhere near good enough, I couldn't reach the rim. My body felt heavy, and it seemed like every time I jumped, it was in memory of all the work I had yet to do. Yet I wouldn't give up. "I began taking small steps towards enhancing my vertical jump. I discovered a strength and conditioning coach who designed a regimen of weight lifting, plyometrics, and jump techniques. I sprinted in the uphill park and repeated jump routines until my legs were burning.</p>
          
          <p>The consequences of this lifestyle manifested gradually but severely. My productivity actually decreased despite spending more hours at my desk. I would stare at code for hours without comprehending it, make careless mistakes that required extensive debugging, and struggle to grasp concepts that should have been straightforward. My health suffered too—I caught every cold that went around campus, developed persistent headaches, and experienced constant fatigue that no amount of coffee could remedy. The following issues became my daily reality:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating during lectures and unable to retain information effectively</li>
            <li>Increased anxiety and stress levels that made simple tasks feel overwhelming</li>
            <li>Deteriorating relationships with friends and family due to irritability and lack of time</li>
            <li>Declining academic performance despite spending more time studying</li>
            <li>Physical symptoms including frequent headaches, weakened immune system, and digestive problems</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
          <p>I made dunking my obsession. I tracked my vertical leap with a Vertec jump trainer, celebrated every inch gained, and committed to recovery and a strict diet. I studied videos of David Carlos "Air David," the number one Filipino pro dunker, rewinding his movements until I could almost feel his technique in my own jumps. I wasn't just training my body to jump higher, I was training my mind to believe.

Then came the breakthrough. One afternoon session, I exploded off the ground with everything I had. For the first time, the ball went over the rim and exploded into the net. The sound was pure adrenaline. My heart was pounding, my hands were shaking, and I knew that this was what I had been working towards. From that point onwards, I worked even harder. Windmills, tomahawks, every dunk was a new task, a new work of art. Every failure taught me timing and every success just made me hungrier. Dunking was no longer an art. Dunking was me.</p>
          
          <h3>The Learning Lesson</h3>
          <p>I have learned that dunking has taught me more than just how to jump. Dunking has provided me with the opportunities to acquire steadfastness, unyielding willpower, and the capacity for self-confidence. But what began as a complaint about not being able to touch the rim has become an exquisite transformation. Now, when I see the rim it is not just a rim. I can see all of the untiring hours of sweat and toil that have brought me to where I am today; Before my eyes is constant, determined perseverance in which only success will be greeted with success all the time. At last, Dunking has been more than just a dream, it's a living proof that even attempting to do those things one could never succeed in accomplishing turns out, if you do truly strive in order to match those impossible tasks accomplished, to be possible after all. This is just a beginning in my journey to become a pro dunker back in the Philippines.</p>

        <h2 id="blog3-title">🔒 Blog Story Part 3: A Cybersecurity Mission</h2>
        
        <article>
          <h3>The Defenders</h3>
          <p>I still remember the first time I heard about a major data breach about the "I LOVE YOU VIRUS". Millions of computers were affected, personal files were corrupted and companies lost their businesses in huge losses. The thing that impressed me most was the fact that something that appears so innocent can make our digital world so vulnerable. What was even more remarkable was its origin: the virus was backtraced to Philippines and one move made in a single part of the globe could spread all over the online world. That was the time when I started to question myself: Who protects us online? The question stayed with me. When I began to learn about technology and understand the mechanics of the systems, I got to know that cybersecurity was not only a subject, but it was a mission. In my case, it does not have to do with pursuing the fad job. It is about being in the line of defense in a world where threats are seen but very destructive.</p>
          
          <h3>Personal Drive</h3>
          <p>We live in a time when almost everything we do shopping, studying, banking, even connecting with friends happens online. That convenience comes with risks. Hackers don't just target big corporations; they go after everyday people too. This information makes me wish to come forward to become one of those people who can ensure that those online doors remain closed. Cybersecurity is not a matter of technology and about trust protection. I have always wondered how things are done. It was either playing with devices or getting to know the fundamentals of programming, but I liked solving puzzles and getting answers. However, after learning about the existence of hackers and how they use vulnerabilities, it occurred to me that there could be more to curiosity: I could protect rather than strike. It is that change of attitude that drives me. I would wish to defend with my abilities and not to harm. It is as though it is the correct ratio of my technology affection and the worth of the principles of duty and service. The second factor that makes cybersecurity interesting to me is that it undergoes constant change. The threats are daily changing and so are the weapons to combat them. That is to say that I will be learning, adapting and growing. I do not want a job that is stagnant, I want a job that I get challenged to remain sharp. It could be ethical hacking, it could be digital forensics or it could be risk management, the opportunities in this area are inexhaustible.</p>
          
          <div class="callout">
            <p>🎯 <strong>My Mission:</strong> To protect people from violations of privacy and security in an increasingly digital world.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3>A Safer Digital Future</h3>
          <p>As I look toward my future career in cybersecurity, I am motivated by the vision of a safer digital world where people can trust the technology they use daily. This vision extends beyond simply preventing attacks—it encompasses creating systems that respect privacy, protect vulnerable populations, and maintain the integrity of digital infrastructure that our society increasingly depends upon. I want to contribute to developing security solutions that are not only technically robust but also accessible and understandable to non-technical users.</p>
          
          <p>My immediate goals include obtaining industry certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), gaining practical experience through internships with cybersecurity firms, and continuing to participate in bug bounty programs and security research. Long-term, I aspire to work on critical infrastructure protection, helping to secure systems that millions of people rely on daily—from banking networks to healthcare systems to power grids. I also want to give back to my community by conducting cybersecurity awareness workshops and helping small businesses and organizations that lack the resources to properly protect themselves from digital threats.</p>
          
          <p>The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, with new threats emerging daily and attackers becoming increasingly sophisticated. This dynamic nature is both challenging and exciting. It means that learning never stops, complacency is dangerous, and innovation is essential. But it also means that dedicated individuals can make a real difference. Every vulnerability discovered and patched, every attack prevented, every user educated about security best practices contributes to a safer digital ecosystem. This is my mission, and I am committed to pursuing it with passion, integrity, and unwavering dedication to protecting the digital world we all share.</p>
